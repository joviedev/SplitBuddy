/**
 The main entry point for the SplitBuddy application.

 `SplitBuddyApp` defines the core structure of the application, including its data management and user interface. It uses a shared `ModelContainer` to handle the core data models (`BillModel`, `FoodModel`, and `PeopleModel`) and ensures that data is persisted. The app's UI is defined using a `WindowGroup` and `ContentView`, which is the root view of the app.

 - Properties:
   - sharedModelContainer: A `ModelContainer` instance that manages the core data models and supports persistent storage.
 
 - Example:
 ```swift
 SplitBuddyApp()
*/

@main
struct SplitBuddyApp: App {
    
    /**
     A shared `ModelContainer` that manages the appâ€™s core data models.
     - The container is initialized with a schema containing `BillModel`, `FoodModel`, and `PeopleModel`.
     - The container supports persistent storage to ensure that data is saved to disk rather than being kept in memory only.
