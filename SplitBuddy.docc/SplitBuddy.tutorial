# ``SplitBuddy``

Welcome to the documentation for **SplitBuddy**, a bill-splitting application designed to make sharing costs easier for groups. This guide will walk you through the essential concepts, models, and tools provided by the app to help you understand and use it effectively.


## Overview

`SplitBuddy` is a SwiftUI app that allows users to create, manage, and split bills among people. It integrates various features such as handling different currencies, splitting bills either equally or by items, and offering seamless user experiences with SwiftUI. Below are the main models and views that drive the functionality of the app.

### BillModel
The `BillModel` class represents the overall structure of a bill, including the people, items (foods), and whether the bill is split equally or by items. Itâ€™s the backbone of the app's functionality.

### HomeModel
The `HomeModel` struct represents data that is shown on the home screen, providing users with key actions such as creating a bill, viewing history, and checking exchange rates.

### FoodModel
The `FoodModel` class holds the food items on a bill, including their names, prices, and any relevant relationships to the people who ordered them.

### PeopleModel
The `PeopleModel` class manages people involved in a bill, tracking their name, the amount they owe, and their relationship to the food items. It also handles the logic for splitting bills either equally or by items.

## Tutorials
### Bill Splitting
`SplitBuddy` provides two main ways of splitting a bill:
- **Equally**: Where the total amount is divided evenly among participants.
- **By Items**: Where each person pays only for the food items they consumed.
