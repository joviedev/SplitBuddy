# How to Split a Bill by Items

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll go over how to split a bill by items, so each person pays only for the food they consumed.

## Step 1: Create a Bill

1. Start by tapping "Create Bill" on the home screen.
2. Enter a name for the bill (e.g., "Lunch at Cafe").

## Step 2: Add Food Items

1. Enter the food items and their respective prices.
   - Burger: $10.00
   - Salad: $7.00
   - Coffee: $3.00

## Step 3: Choose Split Method

1. After adding the items, choose **Pay Per Items**.

## Step 4: Assign Items to People

1. Add the people involved in the bill.
2. Assign specific food items to each person. For example:
   - Person 1 gets the Burger.
   - Person 2 gets the Salad and Coffee.

The app will calculate how much each person owes based on the items they were assigned.

## Step 5: Review and Save

1. Review the total for each person.
2. Add tax if necessary, and the final amounts will update accordingly.
3. Tap "Save" to store the bill details.

### Example

With the food items above, if Person 1 ordered only the Burger, they will owe $10.00. Person 2, who ordered the Salad and Coffee, will owe $10.00.
