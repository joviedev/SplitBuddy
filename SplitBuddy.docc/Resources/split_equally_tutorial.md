# How to Split a Bill Equally

This tutorial will guide you through splitting a bill equally using SplitBuddy.

## Step 1: Create a Bill

1. Open SplitBuddy and tap "Create Bill" on the home screen.
2. Enter the title for the bill (e.g., "Dinner with Friends").

## Step 2: Add Items

1. Enter the food items and their prices. For example:
   - Pizza: $15.00
   - Pasta: $12.00
   - Drinks: $8.00

## Step 3: Choose Split Method

1. After adding all the items, you will be asked to choose a split method.
2. Select **Split Equally**.

## Step 4: Add People

1. Add the people who are sharing the bill.
2. The app will automatically calculate how much each person owes based on the number of people and the total amount.

## Step 5: Review and Save

1. The final screen will show how much each person has to pay.
2. You can review the bill, adjust tax if needed, and then tap "Save" to store the bill.

### Example

If you have a total bill of $35.00 and 3 people, each person will owe $11.67. If tax is added, the app will automatically calculate the final amount.
Total = (15 + 12 + 8) = $35.00 With tax = 35 + (35 * 0.10) = $38.50 Each person = 38.50 / 3 = $12.83
