# How to Use Exchange Rates for Conversion

SplitBuddy allows you to calculate the bill in different currencies, thanks to its integration with real-time exchange rates.

## Step 1: Add a Bill

1. Start by creating a new bill with the items and prices.
2. Letâ€™s say the total bill is $100.00 USD.

## Step 2: Enable Currency Conversion

1. When splitting the bill, tap "Currency Conversion."
2. Select the currencies for each person. For instance:
   - Person 1 pays in **USD**.
   - Person 2 pays in **EUR**.

## Step 3: Fetch Real-Time Exchange Rates

1. The app will automatically fetch the latest exchange rates using the `ExchangeRatesTools`.
2. It will apply the correct conversion rate based on the selected currencies.

## Step 4: Review and Save

1. Once the conversion is applied, review the amounts for each person in their respective currencies.
2. The app will show the final bill total in each currency.
